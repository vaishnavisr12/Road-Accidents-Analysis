# Road-Accidents-Analysis - Power Bi
This project delivers a comprehensive analytical assessment of road accident trends, leveraging Power BI to transform raw data into actionable operational insights. The analysis focuses on identifying accident patterns, severity distribution, and key contributing factors, enabling data-driven decision-making for road safety authorities.
Identified that Fatal Accidents account for 8–12% of total cases, while Serious Injuries represent 25–30%.

Observed that Two-wheelers contribute 35–40% of total accidents, making them the most vulnerable category.

Peak accident occurrence observed between 5 PM – 9 PM, contributing nearly 28% of total incidents.

Urban road segments recorded 20–25% higher accident density compared to rural areas.

Seasonal analysis showed a 10–15% increase in accidents during monsoon months.

Regional comparison highlighted Top 3 high-risk zones contributing ~50% of severe accidents.

Built a star schema model separating fact tables (Accidents, Casualties) and dimensions (Location, Vehicles, Time)

Developed DAX measures for severity percentages, casualty ratios, and accident indexes
